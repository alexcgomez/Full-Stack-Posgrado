apt/apt-get clean → cleans the packages and install script in /var/cache/apt/archives/
apt/apt-get autoclean → cleans obsolete deb-packages, less than clean
apt/apt-get autoremove → removes orphaned packages which are not longer needed from the system, but not purges them, use the --purge option together with the command for that.
